I'm Bayliss, a recent graduate of Swarthmore College and past fact-check reporter at USA TODAY.

I: 
- majored in English lit
- minored in computer science
- and minored in French and Francophone lit and culture. 

I am interested in digital journalism and how we can use both humanistic practices and computational tools to inform, connect, and tell stories.
