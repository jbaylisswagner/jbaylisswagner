I'm Bayliss, a recent graduate of Swarthmore College and a freelancer writer and reporter, as well as a coder.

In college, I: 
- majored in English lit, minored in computer science and French and Francophone lit and culture
- reported and served as news and managing editor for _The Swarthmore Phoenix_
- interned as a digital innovation / software/data developer at _The Philadelphia Inquirer_
- spent a semester in Paris, France

Since then, I have: 
- written for USA TODAY as a fact-check reporting fellow
- spent a year teaching English and nannying in Marseille, France
- written numerous freelance articles for The Swarthmore Bulletin and news page 
...just to give an overview.

I am interested in digital journalism and how we can use both humanistic practices and computational tools to inform, connect, and tell stories.
